They are not affected by rotations, making the cube much easier to solve than most (possibly all) other online Rubik&#39;s cube simulators.

Other simulators use libraries or CSS transforms to rotate cubes, but I&#39;ve yet to see one keyboard controllable Rubik&#39;s cube simulator that remains sensible after rotations. If the original right side happens to be on the bottom, pressing the key that used to rotate the right side rotates the bottom instead.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5ca5he">Under the hood, the cube remains stationary while the stickers (colors) get rearranged to simulate rotations of the faces, centers, and entire cube.

Nine copies each of the strings &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;white&quot; had to be rearranged precisely as they are when a real Rubik&#39;s cube is rotated.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1i7sgwk">Substituting a new arrangement of the stickers (colors) for the previous one doesn&#39;t require much of the browser engine&#39;s memory or processing capability, and making the substitution requires very little time; so, rather than write another elaborate recipe for the reverse rearrangement, I simply ran the 90 degree rotation three times. It was sure to work as well as running it once, so no testing or bug-hunting was necessary. Here&#39;s the code for rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise on the Z axis</p>`;
